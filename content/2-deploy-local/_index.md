For increased security, we recommend that you configure multi-factor authentication (MFA) to help protect your AWS resources.

You can enable **one** MFA device (of any kind) per root user or IAM user. 

In this guide, we will go through 3 MFA options:
1. [Install Dependencies](1-install-dependencies)
2. [Deploy Application](2-deploy-application)
3. [Test Application](3-test-app)
