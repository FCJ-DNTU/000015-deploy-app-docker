To understand why we should deploy applications on Docker containers using Docker as the foundation, instead of using the personal computer's platform as the base.

For the end-user's application to work (such as adding or editing information), we need one or more servers to handle user requests. In this case, one or more servers will use the resources of the host machine.

In this section, we will deploy a sample application on a personal computer to observe and evaluate.
