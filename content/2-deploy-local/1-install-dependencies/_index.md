For better understanding, you should follow the video below to install NodeJS on your personal computer.

#### Install MySQL Community

Similarly, watch this video to install MySQL:

Some notes when installing MySQL:

- You should install both **MySQL Client** and **MySQL Server** for easier testing. Also, install **MySQL Workbench** and **MySQL Shell**, which is a database management system similar to Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for Microsoft SQL Server. You may need them in some future projects.
- In MySQL, there are two types of users: Root User and other users, each with different roles. Always remember the password for the Root User, and add a new account when installing MySQL Server.

#### Results

Once NodeJS is installed, npm will also be included in the package. Check whether NodeJS and npm have been successfully installed using the following two commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Search for `MySQL Shell` in the Windows search bar, then select `MySQL Shell`.

Type `\sql` to switch the Input Mode to MySQL.

![2.1.4](/images/2-deploy-local/2.1.4.png)

Then, connect to the MySQL Server.

{{% notice note%}}
If you didnâ€™t create a user during the MySQL installation, you can connect to the MySQL Server using the Root User. In that case, the **connection string** will be `root@localhost`, and don't forget to enter the Root User password you set during installation.

Use the `SHOW DATABASES;` command to check the result again.

If you get this result, it means you have installed this part correctly and can proceed to the next section.
