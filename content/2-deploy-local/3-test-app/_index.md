#### Check Deployment Results

First, we need to go to the URL that was opened during the previous deployment: `http://localhost:5173`. At that point, you will see the following interface:

![2.3.1](/images/2-deploy-local/2.3.1.png)

Use one of the following accounts to log in:

- User: email `user@example.com`; password `123456`.
- Admin: email `admin@example.com`; password `123456`.

After logging in, you will see the content on the web as follows:

![2.3.2](/images/2-deploy-local/2.3.2.png)

Navigate through some other pages to see more results:

![2.3.3](/images/2-deploy-local/2.3.3.png)

![2.3.4](/images/2-deploy-local/2.3.4.png)

Ok, this proves that our local system has been successfully deployed. In the next section, we will prepare to deploy to **AWS Cloud** using **Docker**.
