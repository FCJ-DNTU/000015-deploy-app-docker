#### Push Docker Image on Amazon ECR

**Amazon Elastic Container Registry** (ECR) is a Docker container image management service integrated with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Pushing an image to ECR is a crucial part of the container deployment process on AWS, allowing images to be stored in a secure environment and easily integrated with other services like ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

#### Push Docker Image on Docker Hub

**Docker Hub** is a popular public container registry that allows developers to store and distribute Docker images globally. When you push an image to Docker Hub, it facilitates sharing your containerized applications with the community, other development teams, or for personal use.
